# Indonesia-Throughout-Covid19

## Introduction
This project is based on real live data (up to 30 January 2022) from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths.
I split the data into two files so the data is not filled with too many columns.

The purpose of this project is to explore Indonesia performance in general for handling COVID-19 compared to the neighbor countries in South East Asia (SEA).

In summary, the [code](https://github.com/salmanzf/Indonesia-Throughout-Covid19/blob/main/Visualization%20COVID%20in%20Indonesia.sql) will tell you about:
- NewCases/Population (%) = Case Rates
- NewDeaths/TotalCases (%) = Death Rates
- PeopleVaccinated/Population (%) = Vaccine Rates

## COVID-19 in Indonesia
But before we look at the performance from neighboring countries, let's see COVID-19 activity in Indonesia with this graph:
![COVID19 Effects](https://github.com/salmanzf/Indonesia-Throughout-Covid19/blob/main/Indonesia%20Covid%20Effects.png)

From March 2020 until January 2022, in general Indonesia has decreasing death rates and fluctuating case rates according to the graph. There is a certain period of time which caused cases rate to spike and will be explained in the next graph. Vaccination in Indonesia start in early 2021 and has grown to well above 60% for atleast people with 1 dose of vaccine. If we look at the graph, vaccination has higher correlation to death rates rather than cases rates. This imply vaccination is lowering the lethal effect COVID-19 in Indonesia.

## COVID-19 in Indonesia Compared to Countries in South East Asia (SEA)
Now we know the COVID-19 activity in Indonesia, let's compare it with the neighboring countries.

### People Vaccinated in Indonesia
Let's look at the projection. In terms of Vaccination Rate, at the end of January 2022 Indonesia is ranked 6th among SEA nations at 66.65% people vaccinated. This number also below the average of world countries which is 69.88% with a difference of ~3%, which is not a good indicator.

### Cases & Death Rates in Indonesia
- Cases Rates
  Similar to some of the countries in SEA, Indonesia has a high increase in COVID-19 cases in the middle 2021. Overall, by the end of January 2022 Indonesia has the   lowest cases rates among SEA countries at **0.003%** which is below the average at among its countries at 0.13%
### Anomaly on The COVID-19 Cases Spike
There is a similarity in some of countries at the Cases Percentage graph, where the COVID-19 cases rise drastically in a short time (where we call anomaly at the previous graph). Indonesia, Malaysia, and Myanmar have similarities where the rises of COVID-19 happened at June 2021 and Singapore at later month. By further research, the speculation this happened is because of the new COVID-19 variant called Delta especially in Indonesia based on this [news](https://regional.kompas.com/read/2021/08/15/124633678/dinkes-sebut-covid-19-varian-delta-sudah-ada-di-kalbar-sejak-juni-2021) arrived at June 2021. This is supported by Death Percentage graph where there is also an incerase at July 2021 (Indonesia & Myanmar), a month after the Delta variant arrive at Indonesia.
