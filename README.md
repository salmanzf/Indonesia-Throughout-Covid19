# Indonesia-Throughout-Covid19

This project is based on real live data (up to 30 January 2022) from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths.
I split the data into two files so the data is not filled with too many columns.

The purpose of this project is to explore Indonesia performance in general for handling COVID-19 compared to the rest of the world.

In summary, the code will tell you about:
- TotalCases/Population (%)
- TotalDeaths/Cases (%)
- TotalVaccinated/Population (%)

This project also show the performance through visualization by using Tableau with the following dashboard:
