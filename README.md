# Indonesia-Throughout-Covid19

This project is based on real live data (up to 30 January 2022) from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths.
I split the data into two files so the data is not filled with too many columns.

The purpose of this project is to explore Indonesia performance in general for handling COVID-19 compared to the rest of the world.

In summary, the code will tell you about:
- TotalCases/Population (%)
- TotalDeaths/Cases (%)
- TotalVaccinated/Population (%)

This project also show the performance through visualization by using Tableau with the following dashboard:

We can conclude that Indonesia is performing "fine" regarding the preventation of COVID19 with 19.71% Vaccination Rate and 1.55% Cases Rate. However Indonesia is "slightly worse" regarding the treatment, because despite the low cases rate it has slightly more death rate (3.3%) than other countries with so much higher cases rate like USA.
