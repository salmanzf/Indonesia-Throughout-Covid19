# Indonesia-Throughout-Covid19

This project is based on real live data (up to 30 January 2022) from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths.
I split the data into two files so the data is not filled with too many columns.

The purpose of this project is to explore Indonesia performance in general for handling COVID-19 compared to the neighbor countries in South East Asia (SEA).

In summary, the [code](https://github.com/salmanzf/Indonesia-Throughout-Covid19/blob/main/Visualization%20COVID%20in%20Indonesia.sql) will tell you about:
- TotalCases/Population (%) = Case Rates
- TotalDeaths/Cases (%) = Death Rates
- TotalVaccinated/Population (%) = Vaccine Rates

But before we look at the performance from neighboring countries, let's see COVID-19 activity in Indonesia with this graph:
![COVID19 Effects](https://github.com/salmanzf/Indonesia-Throughout-Covid19/blob/main/Indonesia%20Covid%20Effects.png)

From March 2020 until January 2022, in general Indonesia has decreasing death rates and increasing case rates according to the trend lines. Although it looks like there is a steady increase or decrease in the rates, there is a sharp increase in June 2021 for cases rates in July 2021 for death rates. Vaccination in Indonesia start in early 2021 and has grown to well above 60% for atleast people with 1 dose of vaccine.

Now we know the COVID-19 activity in Indonesia, let's compare it with the neighboring countries.

Let's look at the projection. In terms of Vaccination Rate, Indonesia is ranked 4th among SEA nations although there is a huge margin 3rd and 4th position (almost 2 times). However, despite the low vaccination rate Indonesia has lower Cases Rate compared to SEA nation with higher vaccination rate (Malaysia and Singapore). And not only in Indonesia, SEA nation with lower vaccination rate also has lower cases rate (Laos and Myanmar). This can be implied by one of the two reasons, whether the countries with lower Vaccination Rate has stricter regulation regarding to COVID or there are many COVID patients undetected. In opposite of Cases Rate, Indonesia's COVID Death Rate (3.37%) is 3 timese higher than Malaysia which has ~5 times COVID Cases Rate. This implied that Indonesia still needs to improve its COVID treatment procedures.
